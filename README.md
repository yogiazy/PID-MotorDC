# PID-MotorDC
A PID controller is a type of feedback controller that uses proportional, integral, and derivative terms to adjust the control output based on the error between the desired setpoint and the measured process variable. In the context of a DC motor control system, a PID controller can be used to regulate the motor speed or position.
